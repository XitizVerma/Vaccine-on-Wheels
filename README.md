# Getting Started with Vaccine on Wheels App üíâ

The primary concern regarding COVID-19 vaccination in India is the lack of adequate resources. Most of the hospitals in India face overcrowding and have congested vaccination rooms which put people at the risk of getting infected at the vaccination centre as the social distancing cannot be maintained. Additionally, old and specially-abled people find it difficult to commute to vaccination centres. But since this notion curbs the vaccination process, the problem needs a viable solution. One way to tackle this problem while ensuring a minimum safe social distancing is to use mobile vaccination vans to vaccinate the population. But once opened, a certain number of people need to be vaccinated with a single dose. We need an efficient system that will ensure minimum wastage of vaccines while systematically carrying out the mobile vaccination process. So we built a secure, fully functional website that solves the above-mentioned problem.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
